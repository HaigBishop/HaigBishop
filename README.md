## 🚀 Current Projects

### 📊 Enzyme Kinetics  
EKA is an R Shiny web app for biochemistry researchers and students to simulate and fit enzyme kinetics models, powered by the `enzKinet2` R package. See the [Repo](https://github.com/damacer/enzKinet2).

### 📚 Celiac Microbiome Meta-Analysis  
This work involves aggregating and analysing global microbiome data to uncover microbial signals linked to celiac disease. See the [Repo](https://github.com/CeliacMicrobiomeRepo/celiac-repository).

### 🧬 Micro16S  
Micro16S is a neural network for embedding 16S rRNA gene sequences trained to create dense representations that hold phylogenetic identity of bacteria.

### 🧫 PetriScan
PetriScan is a collection of software for counting colonies on petri dishes. Mobile apps are coming soon.

### 📁 SwapBytes
SwapBytes peer-to-peer file-bartering CLI built in Rust with `libp2p` and an TUI powered by `ratatui`. See the [Repo](https://github.com/HaigBishop/swapbytes).

### 🧂 saltcube
This is an interactive web application for simulating a cube of salt in H2O. Built with TypeScript and Wasm-compiled Rust for the simulation code. See the [Repo](https://github.com/HaigBishop/saltcube).

## 🗂️ My Other Repos

### 🌲 redvals
A Python package for obtaining and accessing Relative Evolutionary Divergence (RED) values from GTDB phylogenetic trees. See the [Repo](https://github.com/HaigBishop/redvals).

### ✂️ extract16s
This is a CLI tool for extracting variable regions from 16S rRNA sequences. See the [Repo](https://github.com/HaigBishop/extract16s).

### 🪱 Pillar Centroid Tracker
PCT is a purpose-made computer vision desktop application allowing for  the measurement of forces produced by fungi. See the [Repo](https://github.com/HaigBishop/pillar-centroid-tracker).

### 💧 Particle Distortion Analysis
PDA is a purpose-made computer vision desktop application allowing for the analysis of microaspiration (or ion pipette aspiration) data. See the [Repo](https://github.com/HaigBishop/particle-distortion-analysis).
